# Causal Modeling

Models in physical and engineering domains explicitly encodes causal relationship, hence are used extensively for further study and analysis. Other types of models merely captures correlations and the results cannot be trusted for scientific purpose. Structural Causal Models (SCM) developed by Judea Pearl captures the mechanisms that govern a given phenomenon in form of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It consists of three things:

- A set of variables:
  - endogeneous (variables that model is trying to explain)
  - exogeneous (independent variables)
- A set of functions that give values to each variable based on other variables

SCM models are usually represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
