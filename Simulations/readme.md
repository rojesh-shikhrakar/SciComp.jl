# Simulations

The major themes here are:
- Representation: How do we encode information about the world in a computational model ? How does the choices we make in the representation affect the computability of the problem ?
- Decomposition: How do we beak a large and diverse problem into multiple simpler parts ?
- Discretization: How do we discretize space, time and signals into a smaller pieces ?
- Verification and validation: How do we build confidence in the result of a model ?
