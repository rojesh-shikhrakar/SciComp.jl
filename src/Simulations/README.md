# Simulations

Once a model is specified, one need to program it and run or simulate it multiple times to study different numerical results in a computer based virtual environment. The program generated needs to be verified to check if the model is accurately implemented and validated with known benchmark results. This allows us to judge if the models predictions are acceptable in a new situation.

The General workflow becomes

data ⟶  input  ⟶ process ⟶ model ⟶ visualize ⟶ output ⟶ Verify & Validate

Since computers are digital systems, most of the analysis are performed numerically. Numerical analysis involves construction and analysis of efficient discrete algorithms to solve continuous problems using large amounts of data. In order to solve for continuous problems, we have to discretize the continuous quantities with iterations and approximations.

data ⟶  input  ⟶ process ⟶ model ⟶ discretize ⟶ solve ⟶ visualize ⟶ output ⟶ Verify & Validate
